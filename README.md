# Final-Project (Rice University May 2022)

Final Project for Rice University
This project is a comprehensive review of key concepts learned in class. The files will be available with the various reports as well as the PowerPoint presentations for the final class.

The yaml file WPandApache.yml will allow a user to quickly execute an update process for the vulnerable/obsolete Apache server and the WordPress update to prevent enumeration.

The objective was to practice a number of various things learned throughout the bootcamp course and pretend to act as a pentester and a SOC analyst.

Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.

Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.

Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.

Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
